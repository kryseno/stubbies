# About Stubbies
Stubbies was designed for students by students. It is a social networking application that allows students to create or join study groups with other students that are located in their area.

## Joining an Event
Joining a study group is easy! The 'Join' page displays a list of current study events, as well as, a search bar and map to pinpoint events according to a student's desired location.

## Creating an Event
Students may create study groups by submitting a form to set an event's pertinent information such as the subject to be studied, date/time/location, number of desired study buddies, study event duration, and a short description of the study group's goal for the event.

## User Login
To join or create an event, a student must have a valid Facebook account. Simply click on "Log In With Facebook"!

## User Profiles
Once a student is logged in, a profile page will be available to view study groups they have joined or created.
  
# Purpose
Stubbies aims to connect students from any school, any time, and any place to limit as many study constraints as possible. Make a new friend in the process! Stubbies encourages studious minds and friendlier faces to develop organization skills and make a new friend in the process; all while getting their study material on lock down. It just takes one study group to keep your study habits golden!
