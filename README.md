## About Stubbies
Stubbies was designed for students by students. It is a social networking application that allows students to join or create study groups with other students that are located in their area.

### Joining an Event
Joining a study group is easy! The 'Join Event' page displays a list of current study events, as well as, a search bar and map to pinpoint events according to a student's desired location.

### Creating an Event
Students may create study groups by submitting a form on the 'Create Event' page to set an event's pertinent information such as the subject to be studied, date/time/location, number of desired study buddies, study event duration, and a short description of the study group's goal for the event.

### User Login
To join or create an event, a student must have a valid Facebook account. Simply click on "Log In With Facebook"!

### User Profiles
Once a student is logged in, a profile page will be available to view study groups they have joined or created.
  
## Purpose
Stubbies aims to connect students from any school, any time, and any place to limit as many study constraints as possible. Stubbies encourages studious minds and friendlier faces to develop organization skills and make a new friend in the process; all while getting their study material on lock down. It just takes one study group to keep your study habits golden!
